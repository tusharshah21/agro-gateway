# Masajja Division Urban Farming Initiative. (Ufarm)

The area Agricultural Officer has introduced a program to promote and support urban farming
practice while easing market access and improving on the family earnings and livelihoods. As a
refactored software developer, you are invited to implement an information system to support this
program.

## Under this Program

The division is divided into 4 urban wards (LCs), each Urban Ward has an appointed
FarmerOne (FO) who is the contact person for the Agricultural Officer (AO) for purposes of
mobilization, supervision, regulation and support. Fresh Horticulture produce, poultry and
dairy products are the only categories in this program.
The program is named Agro-Indi
